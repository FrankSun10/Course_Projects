3. we followed the recommended creative instructions, which are as follows:

	(1) Users can specify the category of the event when they create or edit the event. The category includes "urgent", "important" and "normal"
	(2) Users can share an particular event to one or multiple registered users. Users can view events that were shared to them and remove the 
	shared the events and go back to their own calendar.
	(3) Users can create new groups and add users to them.
